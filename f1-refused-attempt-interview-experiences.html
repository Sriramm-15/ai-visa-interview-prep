  <div class="dialogue"><span class="vo">Vo:</span> Place your left four fingers on the scanner.</div>
  <div class="dialogue"><span class="me">Me:</span> I left the place ASAP. Soon after I checked my visa status in the evening and it showed "approved", and by next morning it showed "issued". I never rehearsed a single thing 'cause I know these native English speakers catch that stuff in a moment, so I just conversed in a normal manner. This was counter number 26, I believe, with a white middle-aged lady with blue eyes.</div>

  <div class="meta">Date: 30/07/2024 | Attempt: 2 | Consulate: Delhi | University: University of North Carolina at Charlotte</div>
  <div class="dialogue"><span class="vo">Vo:</span> Which University are you going for? (counter No.17, Indian male officer)</div>
  <div class="dialogue"><span class="me">Me:</span> I am going to UNCC to pursue my masters</div>
  <div class="dialogue"><span class="vo">Vo:</span> Why this University?</div>
  <div class="dialogue"><span class="me">Me:</span> I told, UNCC offers a dual specialization on both Data Science and Business Analytics which I am very much interested to pursue my masters in. It is a research oriented university and all the faculty are industrially experienced... (VO interrupted)</div>
  <div class="dialogue"><span class="vo">Vo:</span> What type of research do you want to do?</div>
  <div class="dialogue"><span class="me">Me:</span> (I was about to tell)</div>
  <div class="dialogue"><span class="vo">Vo:</span> VO interrupted and asked: You have just completed your bachelors, what research can you do at your current level?</div>
  <div class="dialogue"><span class="me">Me:</span> I explained about my UG project which is related to Deep Learning and Generative AI (Neural Style Transfer using Deep Learning and Generative AI)</div>
  <div class="dialogue"><span class="vo">Vo:</span> He then asked some 5-8 questions related to my project. (I don’t recall the exact questions he asked). He also asked, all these models are already available, what's new you have done?</div>
  <div class="dialogue"><span class="me">Me:</span> Explained accordingly</div>
  <div class="dialogue"><span class="vo">Vo:</span> Difference between convolutional neural networks and normal neural networks?</div>
  <div class="dialogue"><span class="me">Me:</span> I told something like CNNs have hidden layers...</div>
  <div class="dialogue"><span class="vo">Vo:</span> (After typing for 20-30 seconds) VO asked, what about your funding?</div>
  <div class="dialogue"><span class="me">Me:</span> I started answering, he interrupted and told you are getting your visa.... I ran away without even thanking or looking at the VO..</div>
  <div class="dialogue"><span class="vo">Vo:</span> .............</div>
  <div class="dialogue"><span class="me">Me:</span> I was a little nervous because this was my second attempt (1st attempt 24-07-24), one month after my first attempt. This particular VO was asking too many technical questions for students and he was clearly listening to the answers we gave as far as I know because I fumbled a bit while answering but answered the questions correctly. I saw too many rejections in Delhi for all types of visas. I saw a girl before me not able to answer the questions he was asking and she was clearly nervous. At least 80-85% of rejections happened that day and some students told me the day before had only 10% of approvals but I am not sure if that is correct. I thought I will be rejected again and thought it’s okay even if I don’t get the visa and thought of not going for masters and went to interview. I guess I had luck. My friend went to the same VO the next day, he again asked too many technical questions to him and in the end told him to apply for PhD instead of masters. All the best to those who are having interview.</div>

  <div class="meta">Date: 23/07/2024 | Attempt: 4 | Consulate: Delhi | University: Arizona State University</div>
  <div class="dialogue"><span class="vo">VO:</span> Good morning, which university?</div>
  <div class="dialogue"><span class="me">Me:</span> I am heading to ASU to pursue my BS in Data Science.</div>
  <div class="note">(He asked this while passing documents. Browny bald guy, counter no. 14. He was really nice but was looking for a one-to-one conversation like a friend, not scripted answers.)</div>

  <div class="dialogue"><span class="vo">VO:</span> Hmm, it’s been some time since you passed high school (2022). What have you been doing since then?</div>
  <div class="dialogue"><span class="me">Me:</span> (At this point I knew he was looking for some story rather than a straight answer because he approved 2 tourist visas before me, took a lot of time, patiently checked their DS and listened to their answers in detail.) My reply: Sir, initially I took admission in India because I wasn’t getting a slot for Fall 2022 and my father didn’t want me to have a gap. But last August I left the college because curriculum was oriented towards software and I wanted AI and ML (Data Science). So I joined a vocational program in Data Science, participated in Kaggle competitions, did internship (3 months) and freelancing, and worked on a community project.</div>

  <div class="dialogue"><span class="vo">VO:</span> Oh okay, so are you going to transfer the credits?</div>
  <div class="dialogue"><span class="me">Me:</span> No sir, actually I only did 1 semester and the coursework wasn’t matching, so ASU counted me as a freshman.</div>

  <div class="dialogue"><span class="vo">VO:</span> What about your parents’ occupation?</div>
  <div class="dialogue"><span class="me">Me:</span> My father is into agriculture business and dairy farming. He manages a team of 18 employees and generates annual income of 30 lakhs. My mother runs an e-commerce business selling organic farm products.</div>
  <div class="note">(When they ask this question, they are looking for specific numbers — number of employees or annual revenue/income — not just details about the business.)</div>

  <div class="dialogue"><span class="vo">VO:</span> So in your previous visa interview it was SLU and now ASU, any reason?</div>
  <div class="dialogue"><span class="me">Me:</span> Yes sir, ASU provides a track field in sporting analytics which matches my career goal, that is to work with the Indian cricket team as a sports analyst, with 4 semesters of capstone projects heavily focused on AI and ML with a mixed curriculum of Data Science and Analytics.</div>
  <div class="note">(VO smiled here lol)</div>

  <div class="dialogue"><span class="vo">VO:</span> Congrats, your visa is approved.</div>

  <div class="tips">
    <strong>TIP 1:</strong> When you are standing at the counter, try to analyze the question patterns and behavior of the VO to find out what they are looking for. My VO was patient, so I made sure my story picked interest. Another VO at counter 13 was looking for technical questions from the course itself like “What is software?” and “Architecture?”. He approved 2 girls who had rejections before. All he wanted was your own reason, not scripted answers, and some basics about your course.<br><br>
    <strong>TIP 2:</strong> Write down your strong points in the refusal box in 5-6 lines. Please don’t mention things like 214(b) or “I was nervous,” or “I fumbled” — they don’t care about that. You can say last time you didn’t communicate about [add your highlights: scholarship, work experience, research paper, increased funding since last time, couldn’t prove intention even though...].
